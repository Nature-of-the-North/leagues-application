# Nature of the North - Leagues Application

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

Client project for Prime Digital Academy. We worked with Nature of the North to develop an application for their bouldering leagues. The client wanted climbers in the league to be able to track their climbs every week and submit certain climbs to go towards their team's score. They also wanted a leaderboard so the teams would have visibility into how their team is doing in comparison to other teams in the league. There is also admin functionality that allows the admin to see each team, their climbers, all of the climbs, and mark whether or not the team has paid their league dues. 

To see the fully functional site, please visit: [DEPLOYED VERSION OF APP](www.heroku.com)

### Prerequisites
To start this project please have these set of software programs downloaded to your computer. 
- a Code editor of choice [VS Code ] (https://code.visualstudio.com/) OR [Sublime Text] (https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [postgreSQL] (https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Postico] (https://eggerapps.at/postico/) 
- List other prerequisites here

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Download the code from GitHub.
2. Open the project folder in an editor of your choice. 
3. Create a database named `notn`.
4. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries.
5. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder. Run an `npm install`
6. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
7. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
8. The project will open in a new tab in your default browser!
